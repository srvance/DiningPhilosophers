DiningPhilosophers
==================

Dining Philosophers simulation framework in Java.

This code provides an implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem in Java with basic deadlock
and starvation detection.

I originally wrote this to complement a session about acting out algorithms where we did a physical simulation
then wrote the code to implement the algorithm once we had a tactile feel for it.
